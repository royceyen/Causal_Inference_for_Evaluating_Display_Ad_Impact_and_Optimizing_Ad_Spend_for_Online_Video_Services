# Causal Inference in Advertising: Evaluating Display Ad Effectiveness

This analysis explores the impact of online display advertising through a controlled experiment, drawing from the Harvard Business Publishing case Star Digital: Assessing the Effectiveness of Display Advertising by Sridhar Narayanan and Taylan Yildiz. Star Digital, a video service provider with over $100 million in annual ad spend, faced challenges in accurately measuring the effectiveness of its ad campaigns.

Using statistical methods in R, my analysis evaluates whether ad exposure influences purchase behavior, investigates potential frequency effects, and compares ROI performance across different sites. A power test is conducted to assess whether the sample size is sufficient, followed by a logistic regression to estimate the causal effect of advertising on conversions. The findings provide insights to optimize ad spend and campaign strategies.
